# Fakedown

A fake markdown post generator for Static Site Generators using Markov chains.

This is a WSGI Flask-based web application that generates fake markdown posts using Markov chains with two-word tuples as keys. The corpus has been created using text from various Project Gutenberg sites.

Perfect for quickly generating a large amount of fake blog posts to test Static Site Generators' performance.

It is geared towards [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev), but can be adapted to generate posts compatible with other Static Site Generators.

## Features

- üöÄ Fast markdown content generation using Markov chains
- üåê RESTful API endpoints for different content types
- üìù Supports various content formats (words, phrases, paragraphs, full posts)
- üéØ Jekyll and Eleventy frontmatter support
- üìö Built on Project Gutenberg corpus
- üîß Configurable and extensible

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd fakedown
```

2. Install dependencies using Poetry:
```bash
poetry install
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
poetry shell
```

## Usage

### Web Application

Start the Flask development server:

```bash
poetry run python wsgi.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Production Deployment

For production, use Gunicorn:

```bash
poetry run gunicorn webapp:app
```

### API Endpoints

The service exposes the following `GET` endpoints:

- `/words` -- generates some words
- `/phrase` -- like `/words`, but longer
- `/paragraph` -- some phrases combined in a single paragraph
- `/paragraphs` -- some markdown paragraphs
- `/markdown` -- a complete markdown post, _sans_ front matter
- `/markdown-post` -- as above, with a complete fake front matter
- `/eleventy-post` -- as above

### Example Usage

You can use cURL to generate and save a post:

```bash
# Generate a few words
curl http://localhost:5000/words

# Generate a complete post
curl http://localhost:5000/eleventy-post --output the-post.md
```

There's a live instance of an early version of this package running here: https://fakedown.xoxarle.com/eleventy-post

## Offline Usage

The module `MarkovJekyll.py` can also be executed as a standalone program:

```bash
poetry run python MarkovJekyll.py
```

This will generate 10 markdown posts in 10 different files in the current directory. 

## Using a Custom Corpus

If you want to generate posts using different reference text:

1. Create a large UTF-8 text file containing the text you want to "markov"-ize (Project Gutenberg is a great source).

2. Change the following line in `MarkovJekyll.py`:

```python
markdownGenerator = MarkdownGenerator("word_cache.json")
```

to:

```python
markdownGenerator = MarkdownGenerator("my-text-reference.txt")
```

3. Run the program to generate a new frequency map that will be stored in `word_cache.json`.

## Development

### Code Quality Tools

This project uses several tools to maintain code quality:

```bash
# Format code with Black
poetry run black .

# Lint code with Flake8
poetry run flake8

# Type checking with MyPy
poetry run mypy .

# Run tests
poetry run pytest
```
